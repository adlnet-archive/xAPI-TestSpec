# Workflow for Editing the Experience API Specification

## Set up

### Sign up for a GitHub account
If you do not already have a GitHub account, [sign up](https://github.com/signup/free).

### Fork the ADL repository
Go to the Experience API repository. Fork the repository to your own account using 
the "Fork" button on the top right of Experience API repository page. This makes a 
copy of the Experience API repository. This fork gives you the ability to edit your 
version of the document without impacting the master copy.

### Install Git (use cmd line) or Install Windows/Mac GitHub client

### Clone your GitHub fork to your machine

### Add ADL repository as upstream remote


## Workflow

### Sync up with Base ADL Repository

### Make Changes Locally

### Push Changes to Your Repository (Origin)

### Submit a Pull Request to Base ADL Repository (Upstream)
When you forked from the Experience API repository, a link back to the base repository 
is remembered. To send your changes back the the base repository, click the "Pull Request" 
button at the top of your repository page. This will direct you to a page that gives 
you the ability to submit a request to the base repository to merge in the changes you 
committed.
