# Workflow for Editing the Experience API Specification

## Set up
If you are not currently working with GitHub and git, follow these set up steps 
first. GitHub provides excellent help at https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

### Sign up for a GitHub account
If you do not already have a GitHub account, [sign up](https://github.com/signup/free).


### Fork the ADL repository
Go to the Experience API repository. Fork the repository to your own account using 
the "Fork" button on the top right of Experience API repository page. This makes a 
copy of the Experience API repository. This fork gives you the ability to edit your 
version of the document without impacting the master copy.


### Install Git (use cmd line) or Install Windows/Mac GitHub client
You need to install Git to work with a GitHub repository. If you are on a Windows 
or Mac, you can download the GitHub client app. Otherwise install git from the 
git site.

#### Git
This provides a command line client app for working with a git repository (like 
itHub)  
Download and run [git install](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### GitHub Client
GitHub Client provides a GUI interface to simplify working with a repository on 
GitHub. This does not currently support synchronizing with a base repository so 
some commands will still need to be completed using the command line.

### Clone your GitHub fork to your machine
#### Git
To make edits and work on the files in the repository, clone your repository to 
your local machine using Git. The url is provided on the home page of your 
repository (ex. https://github.com/adlnet/ADL_LRS.git)
```git clone <url_to_your_repository>```

### Add ADL repository as upstream remote


## Workflow

### Sync up with Base ADL Repository

### Make Changes Locally

### Push Changes to Your Repository (Origin)

### Submit a Pull Request to Base ADL Repository (Upstream)
When you forked from the Experience API repository, a link back to the base repository 
is remembered. To send your changes back the the base repository, click the "Pull Request" 
button at the top of your repository page. This will direct you to a page that gives 
you the ability to submit a request to the base repository to merge in the changes you 
committed.
